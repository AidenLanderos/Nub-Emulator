# Nub-Emulator
A simple powershell script that allows the G H and B keys to function similarly to a ThinkPadâ„¢'s trackpoint

Use the right shift key to enable the cursor movment
Use G H and B to move the cursor
Use the right alt key to switch if H+B/G+B moves downward diagonally or sideways
Use the V and N keys to click

This code was slapped together in just a few hours and is still pretty buggy.
While I doubt anyone will really have any use for this I've decided to post it here anyways because there's really no reason not to.
